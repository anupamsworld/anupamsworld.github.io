					If we want to understand the meaning of the word "Programming" then first we should think about the word "Program". "Program" means some series of steps to be carried out or goals to be accomplished.<br>
<br>
For example... <br><i>Today's program</i>: Means here it is being tried to mean that what will be done today<br>
<i>Tomorrow's program</i>: What will be done tomorrow.
<br>

So in computer world "Program" means a finite no of steps / instructions that are formulated to be executed in a computer to accomplish some work or task.<br><br>
Here also, <br>
<i>Addition Program</i>: Program to perform addition function<br>
<i>Division Program</i>: Program to perform Division function<br>
MP3 player: Program to play MP3 in computer
<br>
So likewise whatever we want to perform in computer we need to formulate finite number of commands or instruction so that computer can execute those and can perform accordingly to provide our demand.

					In those days when there was no computer, people used to calculate manually. It may be any counting or any big mathematical calculation.
					<br>
					But as days went on, people were needing more computation in less time. For this need people invented something that can calculate faster than human being.<br>
					At the beginning seperate hardware was used to perform seperate work or calculation. Like punch card. But now that fashion also has been changed. Now one hardware is used but different software of program to perform different work.
					<br><br>
					So in brief this is the need of computer.
					<br><br><br>
					Now probably you can imagine what will be happen if we dont use computer in our modern life.
					Today we are computing lots of computation directly or indirectly in a day. Now if we don\'t use computer our work will take so long time to be finished. In a single word we again will be back in old days. We would need more man power.<br>
					So to do fast computation, we need computer.

Ans: Let three letters; A, B, C .Now let, A knows English,C knows Hindi.
If A wants to tell something to C, it can\'t!! Simply because A don\'t know Hindi,now let me introduce another thing that B knows both English and Hindi !!
The next possible process you may guess! Yesss, absolutely right! A will say the speech to B, then B will transfer the speech From English to Hindi. After that B will say the speech to C in Hindi,then C can understand the speech which is said by A !!!!
Now just imagine A=YOU ; B=COMPILER/INTERPRETER ; C=COMPUTER !!!!
And English=C/++/JAVA/ANDROID etc. ; Hindi=MACHINE LANGUAGE !!!! And speech=ANY INSTRUCTION OR SPEECH,GIVEN BY YOU OR USER Now think what is happening ??

Ans: Ahh...Here the approach differ from person to person depending upon their merit level. But I can give you a generic way to start learning programming.<br><br>
 That is, at the first level dont ever go for writing code after getting any programming problem. First of all think about the problem. Which topic it is related with,
do you have any knowledge behind this logic(which will be helpful to solve the programming problem), if yes then ok otherwise get knowledge. Then write a pseudo code for
the problem. Then if you are very much aware of any programming syntax, go for coding.<br> <a href="efficient_way_to_write_program.html"><button class="green_white_responsive">Know More(expand)...</button></a>
