Lets start from the beginning!<br><br>
I will describe whole topic in two phases: <br>i)For New Learner <br> ii)For those who have just learned programming language and going to solve problem with programming.
<br><br>If you are new learner then you should follow 3 major steps to fulfill your skill on any topic or technology in the programming area.
<br>
1] What is it? :: <br>
In this step you need to know detail information about the topic or technology you are trying to learn. All theoretical knowledge should be gained in this phase.<br>
<br>
2] Syntax and other protocols :: <br>
In this step you need to familiarize yourself with the real technology field to establish a connection between theory and practical orientation. To do so you need to
 know about the rules, syntax, protocols (or any constraint whatever is applicable in that technology) so that you can relate and implement whatever you have learned in step 1.<br>
<br>
3] Implementation :: <br>
Knowledge = Nothing, if you can't implement it properly in proper time. So here also there is no exception.<br>
So, after completing step 1 and 2 means after getting theory as well as technology related knowledge now it is time to implement those stuffs by doing some program.<br>
<br>
At the first level you may feel difficulties but keep patience and implement it in different ways so that you can get to know the consequences.<br>
<br>
Now lets talk about those who have learned programming (recently) and are going to solve problems through programming / trying to do some practice in programming field.<br>
<br>
Let me tell you, I don't know whether you have followed above beginner level steps during your learning process or not but those steps are highly needed in order to get
 good programming knowledge.<br>
After you finish those step you need to focus more on implementation part. Here I always suggest not to go, sit in front of a computer and type coding. Rather I encourage
 people (learner programmers) to make a good plan or I should say make a good understanding about the problem you are going to solve by programming. Make some important notes if
  needed, ultimately make an algorithm for your program. If writing algorithm makes you bore at least you should write a pseudo code. Why because during writing code that pseudo code
 will help you to write your code faster. Otherwise if you dont have any draft (algorithm or pseudo code) you will face many problems while writing code. One of the major problems is at that time you will be
 thinking about the syntax, logic, error, calculation (if any) and bla bla things. And if the volume of the program/logic/problem is so high then probably you will stuck on
 some point thinking about those bla bla things.<br><br>
 Thats why, have a good plan, have a good logic, make algorithm or atleast pseudo code then smash the keyboard... hahaha...I mean then go for coding.<br>
Follow these, you will see the difference by your own.<br>
<br>
<i>All the best. Happy programming !!! :)</i>
